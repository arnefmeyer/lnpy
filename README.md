lnpy
====

lnpy is a Python module for fitting parameters of neuronal stimulus-response 
functions (SRFs; for a review see [1]). While initially developed to estimate 
sensory neuron's receptive field parameters using a linear-nonlinear (LN)
model there are a number of methods to fit other models, e.g., linear and 
multilinear models.

This module is build on top of several excellent Python modules, e.g., 
SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, scikits-learn, statsmodels, and neo. The critical 
parts are written in C(++) and wrapped using Cython.

The main focus is on auditory data and there are several submodules that 
facilitate reading and converting data. However, the estimators may just 
as well be applied to data from different modalities, e.g., the visual or 
somatosensory system.


Included estimators
===================

* Ridge regression (Machens et al. (2004))
* Automatic smoothness determination (ASD, Sahani & Linden (2003))
* Automatic locality determination (ALD, Park & Pillow (2011))
* Spike-triggered average (STA, deBoer & Kuyper (1968))
* Normalized reverse correlation (NRC, Theunissen et al. (2000))
* Generalized linear model (GLM, Paninski (2004), Truccolo et al. (2005))
* Maximum informative dimensions (MID, Sharpee et al. (2004)); requires external software
* Classification-based receptive field estimation (CbRF, Meyer et al. (2014a))
* Time-varying RF estimation using non-zero mean priors (Meyer et al. (2014b))
* Stochastic gradient descent-based versions of some of the above 
estimators (Meyer et al. (2015))

Moreover, the toolbox has been designed such that most models can be used with
a number of different priors, e.g., Gaussian and Laplace priors, and also 
mixtures of these priors.


Dependencies
============

lnpy works under Python 2.7 and Python 3.6  (other Python versions have not been tested; avoid Python 3.7 as there might be problems with a number of packages) and requires a working C/C++ compiler.

The required dependencies to build the package are

	* NumPy >= 1.6.2
	* SciPy >= 0.12
	* cython
	* matplotlib >= 1.2.1
	* statsmodels >= 0.4.2
	* neo >= 0.3
	* scikit-learn >= 0.14
	* sphinx
	* sphinxcontrib-napoleon

Installation
============

Linux
-----

1. Install Python (recommended: [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

2. Install dependencies, e.g.,

	`pip install numpy scipy matplotlib neo`
	(or `conda install` when using anaconda )

3. Install packages required to build some of the cython extensions:

	`sudo apt installlibc6-dev g++`.

4. Install package by changing into the package directory and typing

	`python setup.py install`

   If you just want to compile the code in the package directory use

	`python setup.py install build_ext -i`


Windows 7
---------

1. Install the latest version of WinPython 2.7.x.x (64 bit version)

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/

	I haven't tested Python(x,y) but it should also work. 


2. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express edition

	http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/5/4/A54BADB6-9C3F-478D-8657-93B3FC9FE62D/vcsetup.exe


3. Install Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 

	http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3138

	Note: this gives you the 64 bit compiler. However, you don't have to install all components.
	Just uncheck everything except "Developer Tools >> Visual C++ Compilers" (and the header files).


4. To install the package, open the WinPython command prompt ("WinPython Command Prompt.exe" in WinPython directory) and type

	"XXX:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\Common7\\Tools\\vsvars64.bat"

	where "XXX" denotes your system's root directory (probably "C")


5. Install dependencies; open the WinPython command prompt ("WinPython Command Prompt.exe" in WinPython directory) and type

	pip install neo


6. Install package by changing into the package directory and typing

	python setup.py install


That's all!
